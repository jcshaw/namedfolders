<item type="*">Procedure of removing douple prefixes is changed. In previous
versions NF, command "cD:ab:command" was equal to "cd:command" and  
command "cd:cd:cd:command" didn't work at all. Now, the plugin ignores
all prefixes except last one. So, the command "ab:cd:ef:command" is
equal to "ef:command".</item>
<item type="*">Search in local paths is changed. No, the command "cd:alias.." 
can be written in more classic way "cd:alias\..". Both variants ".." and "\.."
are supported to specify parent folder.</item>

plugin searches subfolders using mask "a*" (not "*a*" as previously).</item>
<item type="*">If you copy directory on the plugin panel, dialog of alias
creation appears. So, you are able to edit name of alias. In previous versions
of the plugin, there was no possibility to make the edition.</item>
<item type="-">Mode "Show all variants" didn't work.</item>
<item type="!">Now ".." is used in local paths to specify "jump on one level above" 
(instead of "."). It allows to use char "." in masks, i.e. "cd:f\*.exe"</item>
<item type="-">Search with local path can lead to path duplicates in list of 
path variants.</item>
<item type="-">Shortcuts with characters "#", "@", "(", ")" in name didn't work.</item>

path or name of alias. For typing local characters (i.e. russian) press SHIFT.</item>
<item type="+">New configuration parameter "Use single menu mode". 
It specify the behavior of the "cd:a\b" commands. If this flag is set off,

If this flag is set on, the plugin shows single menu with all paths 
available for all aliases.</item>
<item type="-">Fixed bug with opening paths which contain russian letters.</item>
<item type="-">Fixed bug in the command "cd: :soft" - russian letters in
the path were stored in the clipboard in the wrong encoding.</item>

with and without group name.</item>
<item type="*">New macros "FastPrefix.reg" replaced "FastPanel.reg".

switches current keyboard layout to the english one (FAR 1.7 alpha 6 is required)</item>
<item type="*">Tree-like mode of catalog's showing was removed.</item>
<item type="*">A state of named folders is checked in the Ctrl+8 panel mode only.

the "param" was absolute path to the file.</item>
<item type="+">Now you can stop search of the local paths by 
pressing Esc.</item>
<item type="+">Now you can use two directions of the search in the
mask of local directory. "\" is used to search in subdirectories,
"." is used to search in parent directories. So you can use
such masks as "cd:a\\path", "cd:a..path", "cd:a.*\path", etc.
Note: "." is special symbol now, you should not use it in the names
of shortcuts.
</item>
<item type="+">Now it's possible to make global search of local path

for virtual directory (to clear current command line content before
sending there keys sequence).</item>
